     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Computational Methods and Modeling for Engineering Applications (GENG 8030) is a foundational graduate course in the Master of Engineering (MEng) program at the University of Windsor. This course focuses on developing the advanced computational skills essential for professional engineers, encompassing MATLAB programming, numerical methods for calculus and differential equations, and Simulink-based system modeling.

### Course Objectives

The curriculum encompasses several key computational and modeling domains:
- **MATLAB Foundations**: Mastering matrix operations, numeric arrays, and function development for complex engineering tasks.
- **Numerical Analysis**: Applying iterative methods for solving linear algebraic equations, statistics, and interpolation.
- **Calculus & Differential Equations**: Implementing numerical methods for solving advanced calculus problems and differential models.
- **Simulink Modeling**: Developing block-diagram based simulations for dynamic systems and control engineering.
- **Model Building**: Leveraging regression analysis and model optimization for engineering applications.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, course assessments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that computational foundations remain essential for solving complex engineering problems and explaining them with technical precision. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental computational principles
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Computational Methods and Modeling for Engineering Applications
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were created, compiled, and organized by me during the Summer 2023 semester as part of my MEng degree requirements.
